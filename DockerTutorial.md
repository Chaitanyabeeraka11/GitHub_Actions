#### **Step 1: Understanding Docker and its Purpose**
**Explanation:** 
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

**Technical Details:**
- **Containers:** Think of them as lightweight, standalone executable packages of software that include everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
- **Docker Image:** A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
  
#### **Step 2: Write a Dockerfile**
**Explanation:**
A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands to assemble an image. 

**Technical Details:**
- A Dockerfile typically starts with a base image, like `openjdk` for Java applications.
- It then copies the necessary files into the container and sets up the environment to run the application.

**Creating a Dockerfile for the Spring Boot Project:**

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to `C:\Users\gonch\Downloads\demo\demo`.

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   - In the root of your project (`C:\Users\gonch\Downloads\demo\demo`), create a file named `Dockerfile`.

3. **Write the Following Content into the Dockerfile:**
   ```dockerfile
   # Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
   FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Package the application
   RUN ./mvnw package

   # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run the jar file
   CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
   ```

#### **Step 3: Build the Docker Image**
**Explanation:**
Once the Dockerfile is ready, you need to build the Docker image. This image is like a blueprint for running your application inside a Docker container.

**Technical Details:**
- `docker build`: This command creates a Docker image from your Dockerfile.

**Command to Build the Docker Image:**

In your terminal, run:
```bash
docker build -t movie-api-app .
```
- `-t movie-api-app`: Tags the image with the name `movie-api-app`.
- The `.` at the end signifies the current directory as the build context.

#### **Step 4: Run the Docker Container**
**Explanation:**
Now that you have an image, you can create and run a container from this image. 

**Technical Details:**
- `docker run`: This command creates a new container from a Docker image and runs it.

**Command to Run the Container:**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 movie-api-app
```
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container.

#### **Step 5: Access the Application**
**Explanation:**
With the container running, your Spring Boot application should be accessible via your browser.

**Technical Details:**
- Since the application exposes port 8080, you can access the endpoints like `http://localhost:8080/hello` and `http://localhost:8080/api/movies/popular`.

**Testing:**

Open a web browser and navigate to:
- `http://localhost:8080/hello`
- `http://localhost:8080/api/movies/popular`

You should see the responses defined in your Spring Boot application.

#### **Step 6: Managing Docker Containers**
**Explanation:**
You can stop, start, or delete containers as needed.

**Technical Details:**
- `docker stop <container_id>`: Stops a running container.
- `docker start <container_id>`: Starts a stopped container.
- `docker rm <container_id>`: Deletes a stopped container.

**Command Examples:**

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm <container_id>
```

### **Recap**
- **Docker** helps in packaging your application with all its dependencies to ensure it runs on any environment.
- A **Dockerfile** is a blueprint that describes how to build a Docker image.
- **Building** the Docker image packages your application.
- **Running** the container deploys your application in an isolated environment.
  
Using the Feynman Technique, if you can explain this entire process to someone who is unfamiliar with Docker, youâ€™ve likely understood it well.
